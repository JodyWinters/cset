We learned Web Development because it is a standard way to create user interfaces across platforms, but then we learned all of the non-standard aspects that we have to look out for. What does that tell you about building other platform specific user interfaces?

That platform specific user interfaces will continue to be a thing throughout your lifetime. Even if you stick to the more across platforms you will eventually have to work on the more specific ones. So it's a good idea to be aware of them and be able to work with them when the those times come.

Show two examples of CSS Media Queries that use different Media Features. Explain how the user agent will decide to use those rulesets or not.

My first example is the min/max-width media queries. This will look at the total width of the users screen and change your styles for the screen that they are using. For a second example, there is the @media speech, which checks the users device for if they are using a text to speech program and changes your styles accordingly.

Do you think it is better to define Breakpoints using standard device sizes or using the specific content on your site? Why?

I think it's better to define your own breakpoints based on your work. There are hundreds of different device sizes and trying to make your site work for just one standard one could make it unappealing to the rest. Making it to your own breakpoints, to me, means that no matter the size of the screen they are using, you've already made it so that it will look good.
