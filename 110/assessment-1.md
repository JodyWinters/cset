Why do you think it's important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned by one person or company?

  If a single company owned the HTML standard they would have the option to charge money for the use of it. They could change whatever they wish 
in the specifications to benefit themselves and then force people to pay to get the new required version. I would imagine it would deter new 
creaters as well which could make the web quite boring.

Describe the difference between an element and a tag. Use examples.

  A tag is the opening and closing markups used to signify what the items inside are, such as if they are a paragraph. Look at this example here: 
<p>This is a paragraph</p>. 
In this case the "<p>" is the paragraph opening tag and the "</p>" is the closing tag. The element consists of everything that is inside the tags 
including the tags themselves. In that example the element would be the entire "<p>This is a paragraph</p>".

In the lecture, I used two quotes from Yoda and Noam Chomsky to explain syntax and semantics. Explain these quotes and how they relate to the HTML you write.

  The first quote is "The greatest teacher, failure is.". This quote's syntax is not correct, it's not how you would expect someone to talk. However the 
  semantics in this quote are quite good. Reading the quote, you understand perfectly the message he was trying to get across. The second quote, from Chomsky,
  is this: "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.". In this case the syntax is perfect, by the english langauge, it follows all of the rules. Semantically 
  though, it makes no sense. What are they even trying to say? This is good representation of how you should look at your HTML coding. Your biggest concern 
  is to make sure the message or information you want to portray is understandable. I'm not saying syntax is not important as well but, making your ideas 
  look correct should not get in the way of making them understandable.
