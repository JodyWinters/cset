Now that you've spent a few weeks working on longer projects, how do you think you'll adapt to working in the professional world?

I don't think it will be too much of an issue. I already make my plans for how much time I think i'll need to finish a project and set that amount of time ahead of the due date or deadline. That way if something goes wrong I have more time then I thought I would need to fix it. I believe that is a good practice and it is one that has already been working for me.


Imagine you are building your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure project in JavaScript for the browser. The user has clicked a button to select which room to enter, walk through how you would manipulate the page to show the next room's description. Explain the DOM methods you would use and why.

When you press the button a class or id would be entered into a function and used with the querySelector to find the appropriate text. That function could then use replaceChild to replace the current text with the new set of text for that room. The buttons could be disabled similar to how they were done in the 1 to 100 guessing game by using "button.disabled = true", and new ones can be created using createElement to make the buttons that are necessary for the room and assign them their class or id for if they are pressed next.


Why are different data structures useful? Use the Document Object Model as an example. Would it work as any structure other than a tree?

Different data structures are useful because it gives you more options on how to store data so that it is the easiest to access and use. The document model works perfectly with a tree structure because every element in your html will already be nested one inside the other. So its built as if you are looking down the branch of a tree. Trying to structure it differently than a tree would be possible, but I think it would put the information in a less user friendly format.
