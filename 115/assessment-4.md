This is your last assessment of the semester. Overall, how comfortable would you feel answering questions like these in job interviews? Have they helped more than regular tests or quizzes?

After answering the many assessments we've had, I think answering these questions has become easier. I also think they are more beneficial to me even if I don't enjoy them. Answering questions like these have always been one of my weaknesses.

In the readings this week, you learned a sampling of client-side tooling. Choose one tool that you think will be the most beneficial for you. Explain what it does and why that's important.

I think the tool that I'll find I used the most is a linter like eslint. Linters help with making sure your syntax in your code is uniform and correct. When you spend so much time coding you are bound to make small mistakes and syntax errors, so having a linter in the background will take a lot of the frustration out.

Compare the different stages of the Waterfall and Agile methodologies using the Tic-Tac-Toe game as an example.

Both methodologies have similar steps needed for their workflow. The first step is to lay out the requirements needed for the project. The next step is designing or planning how you are going to complete the requirements. Third you do the coding that you planned out. Last you test your code to make sure it works. There is also the maintenance step but thats more after everything. When using the waterfall method, you would complete each of these steps one at a time. When using the agile method, you move back and forth between these steps progressing smaller parts of the project at one time. When we worked on our project we implemented more of an agile method. We separated the requirements and worked on them and tested each as we moved on to the next, building the project little by little.
