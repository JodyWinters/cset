What do you think will be the most difficult aspect of developing a project in a larger team?

I think the biggest issue that will come from working with a big team is the amount of conflicting code and errors that will occur. When so many people are trying to push their own code into a main branch, there is a lot of room for issues.


Briefly describe a branch and a remote. Compare the defaults to examples that you created.

A branch is a series of commits that you make on a project. You can use multiple branches that start from the same point but can be change differently with their own commits. An example of this, is the ben-main branch I made while working on Ben's game. A remote is a repository host on another computer that multiple people can access. An example of a remote would be the cset repository on my github.


For the collaborative project this week, which git workflow(s) did you employ? Why?


For the projects this week we incorporated a mix of the feature branch and the forking workflow. We forked each others repositories and pushed them to our own repositories which is the forking workflow. We also made our own branches for those projects for our own features to be inserted which is part of the feature branch workflow. Both involve using pull request for the group to go over the code before it's merged.
