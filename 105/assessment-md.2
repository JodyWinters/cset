After two weeks, what do you think is going to be your biggest challenge with this program? And how will you try to overcome it?

  I think the biggest challenge I'm going to have in this program is working/studying class material outside of normal class hours. 
It has never been my strong suite to think of work/school outside of an office or classroom. As far as a way to overcome this 
challenge, I have already started planning times to sit down and study material I need to know or concepts that I don't fully understand.

Describe the differences between the three styles of loops: for, while, and do...while.

  A "while" loop is typically used by setting a variable to designate as a counter or a starting value. Then you have a condition, usually based 
on your counter/start value set that when proven false will stop the loop. Inside the brackets is code that will run while it the condition 
is true, usually including a a way for your counter or starting value to move up or down.  A "for" loop does almost the exact same thing except 
that the start/counter, the condition and the counter increase statment are all neatly written together in brackets next to the
"for" function. Therefor the  "for" loop is much easier to read and understand what the loop is accomplishing. A "do-while" loop is written 
similar to the while loop but the loop will always go through its code at least once before it checks the condition.

We've learned to split problem solving into two parts: writing the solution in English or pseudocode, 
then translating the solution into JavaScript. Why is this important and how will it help you in future classes?

  Using psuedocode, in my opinion, is like sperating a problem into to two parts. You start with psuedocode to come up with a solution to the problem
without having to think too much about all of the syntax and technical writing of the code itself. You can decide on the steps needed beforehand
and then translate your "english" solution into code. In other words, it's important because it seperates a big problem into smaller, more 
managable parts and this concept of breaking down difficult problems will also help in future classes.
