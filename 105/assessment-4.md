After completing the first course, how would you rate yourself? Is there anything you want 
to do differently to start the next course?

After completing CSET 105 I would rate my self around 8/10. I feel like I could have done a
lot more research on my own as well as asked questions. In the next course I hope to fix
these issues by asking when I don't know something and spending extra time studying material
that I either find or is linked for my use.


The Weresquirrel program showed many uses for JavaScript Objects and Arrays. Using variables
and values from this example, explain the difference between the two data structures.

In the weresquirrel example the Author makes an Array called Journal that holds multiple Objects
that are used to represent each day. An array is used when you want to store similar values
that you'd want to work with at the same time, such as the Journal storing each day could 
be worked together with a loop. The Objects in the array that represented the days are used to store 
values that won't be worked with and evaluated together and are of different data types, such as the
events that happened that day(strings) and whether he turned into a squirrel(a binary).


Now explain why the author chose to use one structure over the other for each example you chose.
Follow the same reasoning and explain how you could have used objects and arrays in your adventure
game from last week.

If the Author had made the Journal an Object instead of an array, he would not have been able to 
work through the information by using an index number and instead would have had to call each seperate
day location. He couldn't have used an array instead of a Object for the days because he wouldn't
be able to store different types of data.  If I had used arrays on my game I could have easily added
and inventory system to add more choice to the scenarios. if I had used Objects and could have kept a
health bar, name, or other properties of the player and maybe some enemies.
