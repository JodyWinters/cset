In your opinion what is the most important thing you learned this week and why?
 
 The most important thing I feel that I learned this week was the existence of this website. Being able to get feed back from classmates or others in the community is a great tool.  Also having a place to store all of your code and projects together in one place as a portfolio is helpful for job interviews.
  
Describe the general idea of high and low level programming languages using the concept of abstraction.

  A low level programming language will be made to help those of us who have little experience with programming. It will cater to the newer user by giving them easy to use commands or operaters which were already preprogrammed with them in mind. Using a high level programming langauge, you will almost be building everything from scratch. The high level will give you more control over what you want to do, but you need to know a lot more to make it work. The low level will make things much easier to understand but you won't have as much freedom.

Javascript was designed to be flexible with values and types,often jumping back and forth between them.  How might it help you. How might it get in the way?
 
 It will be helpful for when your using inputs from a user. If the user inputs a number, the program will still read it as a string. JavaScript automatically converting that string into a number will help save you time so you don't have to write your own code to convert types.  On the other hand, it might be harmful when you have made a mistake. If JavaScript is automatically converting types, it might not come up with an error message that will lead you to where the mistake was made. Instead you'll spend extra time trying to find where the mistake is before you can even try to fix it.
